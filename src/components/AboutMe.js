                    <p> With a background in psychology and social work, I bring a very human and socially consious perspective
                        to my work in tech.  My biggest passion is making the virtual world safer for youth.  My
                        work with children and youth as a Prevention Specialist has deeply informed the way I develop and design programs.
                        I have experience with public speaking, teaching, and working abroad, which have given
                        me a great deal of experience working with diverse populations.
