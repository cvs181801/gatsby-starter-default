                    <p> Self-Taught Software Developer with a background in Customer Success, Psychology and Social Work. 
                        My biggest passion is making the virtual world safer for youth; my
                        work with young people as a Prevention Specialist has deeply informed the way I develop and design programs.
                        I have experience with public speaking, teaching, and working abroad, which have given
                        me a great deal of experience working with diverse populations.
